Betaflight Configurator is a race drone flight controller configuration tool.

I've used Betaflight Configurator in my Chrome apps for the past 2 years now and seems like an interesting project to be a part of. It is constantly changing based on newly released hardware and firmware (flight controller boards and firmware updates to them).
